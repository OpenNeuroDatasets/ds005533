This dataset contains raw 3T and 7T anatomical and functional MRI data from 1 phantom and 8 human subjects (5 subjects at 3T and 3 subjects at 7T). At 3T, 1 phantom and 5 human subjects underwent a set of anatomical MRI scans with and without the Inknet EEG net. At 7T, 3 human subjects completed a visual task with and without the Inknet EEG net. The visual stimulus was a full-field flickering stimulus.

For the 3T phantom MRI scan, the set of anatomical MRI scans included a T1-weighted MPRAGE, B1 map, and SWI scan. These scans were run without an EEG cap, with the conventioanl copper wire EEG net (Cu-Net), and with the Inknet.

For the 3T human MRI scan, the set of anatomical MRI scans included a T1-weighted MPRAGE, B1 map, FLAIR, SWI, and T2-weighted scan. One subject's (sub-04) T2-weighted sequence was not acquired and one subject's (sub-05) FLAIR image was excluded because of severe head motion. These were all run with and without the Inknet EEG cap.

For the 7T human MRI scan, the anatomical MRi scan is a T1-weighted MPRAGE. The functional scan is a BOLD-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence. In fMRI runs, participants performed a block design visual task with 16-second ON and 16-second OFF blocks to assess visual responses. ON blocks consisted of a 12 Hz flickering radial checkerboard, and OFF blocks consisted of a median luminance grey screen.
